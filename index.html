                I am a student at Weber State University and I am currently studying computer science.
                Although I have also spent way too much time inside history books. I do have other hobbies like gaming and
                building model tanks. Overall experience in computer science is learning how to code primarily in Python, but I
                am currently learning C++ and more on html, css, and Javascript in which I am excited to learn more about.</p>
